**Laboratory Exercise: Searching and Sorting Algorithms**

**Part I. Pre-Lab Questions**

**1.** What is the importance of searching in data structures?

**2.** Why is sorting necessary before performing a binary search?

**3.** Differentiate between linear search and binary search.

**4.** What is meant by “Divide and Conquer” in algorithms?

**5.** When is interpolation search more efficient than binary search?


**Part II. Laboratory Exercises**

**Activity 1 – Implementing Searching Algorithms**
Task: Implement the following searching algorithms in C++:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Interpolation Search

Instructions:
- Create a C++ program named searching_lab.cpp.
- Use a sorted integer array of 10 elements.
- Allow the user to enter a target element to search for.
- Display the index if found; otherwise display “Element not found”.

Guide Questions:
1. Which algorithm executed faster?

2. What happens if the array is not sorted in Binary or Interpolation Search?

3. In what type of dataset would Interpolation Search perform best?


**Activity 2 – Implementing Sorting Algorithms**
Task: Implement the following sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort

Instructions:
- Create a C++ program named sorting_lab.cpp.
- Allow the user to input 10 integers.
- Sort the array using different algorithms and display results.

Guide Questions:
1. Which algorithm was easiest to implement?

2. Which algorithm was the fastest?

3. What is the time complexity of each sorting method?


**Part III. Post-Lab Assessment**
1. Why is sorting a prerequisite for efficient searching?

2. Which sorting algorithm uses a pivot?

3. How does Shell Sort improve Insertion Sort?

4. Give one real-world example where sorting and searching are used together.

5. What did you learn from comparing these algorithms?
